Completed some of Classification Algorithms under supervised learning. Work on RL in progress.

[1. Policy Gradient](https://github.com/mymultiverse/MachineLearning/blob/master/RL/PolicyGrad.py) |
[Ref.](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse-fa17/f17docs/lecture_4_policy_gradient.pdf) |
A parameterized policy optimized.Over learning period probability of taking action with positive rewads inceased and action with negative rewards decreased.   
<!-- [1. Deep Q Network](https://github.com/mymultiverse/MachineLearning/blob/master/RL/DQN.py) |
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) |
Q is a state-action value function. Whcih give a measure of what action is good or bad to take in a perticular state. The action which maximixe the Q function for perticular state is taken. Neural network is used to aproximate this function.... -->
