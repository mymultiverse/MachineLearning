### NA√èVE BAYES

### k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) Method
This is very basic implementation done on iris dataset with tolat 150 samples divided into 80% training and 20% test dataset. Accuracy of 
this model observred with various values of hyperparameter. In this case the optimal performance is at k=4.
