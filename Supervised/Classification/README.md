# Generative Models
### NA√èVE BAYES
Using bayes rule and finding stocastic model for each class assuming independent features. Mean and variances used to fit the gaussian distribution to each class. Plot below shows the probabilty distributsions with respect to two features of iris dataset.

# Discriminative Models
### k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) Method
This is very basic implementation done on iris dataset with tolat 150 samples divided into 80% training and 20% test dataset. Accuracy of 
this model observred with various values of hyperparameter. In this case the optimal performance is at k=4.
